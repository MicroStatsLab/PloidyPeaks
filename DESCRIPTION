Description: PloidyPeaks is a package to quantify population-level genome size variation from flow cytometry data without requiring user input.
	The package uses peak detection algorithms and flow cytometry population definitions to quantify sub-populations.
	The workflow is separated into three parts: 1) gating and 2) peak detection, 3) dataset output.
	Built-in visualizations options are included throughout.
