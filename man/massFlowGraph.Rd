\arguments{
\item{xVariable}{The fluorescence channel on the x-axis}

\item{flowDir}{The directory of the gated .fcs data}

\item{filePath}{The directory of the output .csv file from
\code{flowPeakDetection()} that corresponds to the gated data}

\description{
A function that permits the user to plot flow frames using the output from
\code{flowPeakDetection()}. The user is prompted to choose which set of frames to
plot (all, flagged, or doublet flagged). The chosen flow frames are plotted
using the grid functionality in \code{flowLineGraph()}. The user must ensure the
flow directory and file path correspond to the same set of samples for plotting.

massFlowGraph(
 xVariable = "FITC-A",
